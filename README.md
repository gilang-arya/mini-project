# Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small programming projects written in different programming languages.  
They serve as a personal playground for learning, experimenting, and tracking my progress as a developer.

## Goals
- Store code for small experiments.  
- Learn and practice multiple languages and paradigms.  
- Keep an archive of my programming journey.
